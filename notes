createMultipartUpload() /b2/multipart is called once for each file

client:
	backblaze-b2-multipart/src/index.js    upload(fileIds)
	uploadFile()
		for each file
			bind a bunch handlers
			create a new MultipartUploader
	backblaze-b2-multipart/src/MultipartUploader    constructor(file, options)
	_initChunks()
		calculate chunk sizes by dividing into 5MB segments (TODO this should be the absoluteminchunksize returned by B2?)


When the MultipartUploader start()s, _uploadParts() is called which queues up options.limit parts and calls _uploadPart(index)


b2_start_large_file  (bucketId, filename) -> fileId
b2_get_upload_part_url (fileId) -> uploadUrl, authorizationToken
b2_upload_part (authorizationToken, partNumber) [using uploadUrl]
